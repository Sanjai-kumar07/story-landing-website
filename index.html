            <h1>A p j ABDUL KALAM</h1>
            <p id="para-1">A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong) was an Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.

                Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III,
                
                the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
                
                From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.
                
                In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.
                
                Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform India into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.
                
                Kalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999). Among his numerous awards were two of the country’s highest honors, the Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997).
                Engineering, the application of science to the optimum conversion of the resources of nature to the uses of humankind. The field has been defined by the Engineers Council for Professional Development, in the United States, as the creative application of “scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behaviour under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.” The term engineering is sometimes more loosely defined, especially in Great Britain, as the manufacture or assembly of engines, machine tools, and machine parts.

                The words engine and ingenious are derived from the same Latin root, ingenerare, which means “to create.” The early English verb engine meant “to contrive.” Thus, the engines of war were devices such as catapults, floating bridges, and assault towers; their designer was the “engine-er,” or military engineer. The counterpart of the military engineer was the civil engineer, who applied essentially the same knowledge and skills to designing buildings, streets, water supplies, sewage systems, and other projects.

                Associated with engineering is a great body of special knowledge; preparation for professional practice involves extensive training in the application of that knowledge. Standards of engineering practice are maintained through the efforts of professional societies, usually organized on a national or regional basis, with all members acknowledging a responsibility to the public over and above responsibilities to their employers or to other members of their society.

                The function of the scientist is to know, while that of the engineer is to do. Scientists add to the store of verified systematized knowledge of the physical world, and engineers bring this knowledge to bear on practical problems. Engineering is based principally on physics, chemistry, and mathematics and their extensions into materials science, solid and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, transfer and rate processes, and systems analysis.

                Unlike scientists, engineers are not free to select the problems that interest them. They must solve problems as they arise, and their solutions must satisfy conflicting requirements. Usually, efficiency costs money, safety adds to complexity, and improved performance increases weight. The engineering solution is the optimum solution, the end result that, taking many factors into account, is most desirable. It may be the most reliable within a given weight limit, the simplest that will satisfy certain safety requirements, or the most efficient for a given cost. In many engineering problems the social and environmental costs are significant.

                Engineers employ two types of natural resources—materials and energy. Materials are useful because of their properties: their strength, ease of fabrication, lightness, or durability; their ability to insulate or conduct; their chemical, electrical, or acoustical properties. Important sources of energy include fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas), wind, sunlight, falling water, and nuclear fission. Since most resources are limited, engineers must concern themselves with the continual development of new resources as well as the efficient utilization of existing ones.
                When the father came home, and sat down to dinner, he said, “Where is my son?”
                The mother brought a great big dish of black soup, and Margery cried and cried without 
                ceasing. Then the father said again, “Where is my son?”
                “Oh,” said the mother, “he is gone into the country, to see his uncle, where he is going to 
                stay awhile.”
                “What does he want there? And he has not even said good-bye to me!”
                “Oh, he wished very much to go, and asked if he might remain away six weeks; he is well 
                taken care of there, you know.”
                “Well,” said the father, “I am sorry; for he ought to have bade me good-bye.”
                After that he began to eat, and said, “Margery, what are you crying for? Brother will be sure 
                to come back. Oh, wife,” continued he, “how delicious this food tastes; give me some 
                more.” And the more he ate, the more he wanted; and he said, “Give me more, you shall not 
                have any of it; I feel as if it were all mine.” And he ate and ate, throwing the bones under the 
                table, till he had finished it all.
                But Margery went to her drawers, and took out of the bottom drawer her best silk 
                handkerchief, and fetched out all the bones from under the table; she tied them up in the silk 
                handkerchief, and took them out of doors, and shed bitter tears over them. Then she laid 
                them under the Juniper-tree in the green grass; and when she had put them there, she felt all 
                at once quite happy, and did not cry any more.
                Soon the Juniper began to move, and the twigs kept dividing and then closing, just as if the 
                tree were clapping its hands for joy. After that there went up from it a sort of mist, and right 
                in the centre of the mist burnt a fire, and out of the fire flew a beautiful bird, who, singing 
                deliciously, rose up high in the air. When he was out of sight, the Juniper-tree was just as it 
                had been before, only the handkerchief with the bones was gone. But Margery felt quite 
                pleased and happy, just as if her brother were still alive. And she went back merrily into the 
                house to dinner.   The bird flew away, sat himself on a goldsmith’s house, and began to sing—
                “My mother, she killed me;
                My father, he ate me;
                My sister, little Margery,
                Gathered up all my bones,
                Tied them in a silk handkerchief,
                And laid them under the Juniper-tree:

                <h1>The Juniper Tree</h1>
                    <p id="para-2">
                        One or two Thousand year ago,there was a rich man, who had a beautiful and pious wife; they loved one another dearly, but they had no children. 
                        They wished and prayed for some night and day, but still they had none. In front of 
                        their house was a yard, where stood a Juniper-tree, and under it the wife stood once in winter, and peeled an apple, and as she peeled the apple she cut her 
                        finger, and the blood fell on the snow.“Oh,” said she, sighing deeply and looking sorrowfully at the blood, “if I only had a child as 
                        red as blood, and as white as snow!”While she spoke, she became quite happy; it seemed to her as if her wish would surely come 
                        to pass. Then she went into the house; and a month passed, and the snow melted; and two 
                        months, and the ground was green; and three months, and the flowers came up out of the 
                        earth; and four months, and all the trees in the wood burst forth, and the green twigs all 
                        grew thickly together; the little birds sang so that the whole wood rang, and the blossoms fell 
                        from the trees. The fifth month passed, and she stood under the Juniper-tree, and it smelt so 
                        beautiful, and her heart leaped with joy. She fell upon her knees, but could not speak. When 
                        the sixth month was gone, the fruit was large and ripe, and she was very quiet; the seventh 
                        month, she took the juniper berries, ate them eagerly, and was sick and sorrowful; and the 
                        eighth month went by, and she called to her husband, and cried and said, “If I die, bury me 
                        under the Juniper-tree.”
                        After this she was quite comforted and happy, till the next month was passed, and then she 
                        had a child as white as snow and as red as blood. When she beheld it, she was so glad, that 
                        she died.
                        Her husband buried her under the Juniper-tree, and began to mourn very much; but after a 
                        little time, he became calmer, and when he had wept a little more, he left off weeping 
                        entirely, and soon afterwards he took another wife.
                        The second wife brought him a daughter, but the child of the first wife was a little son, and 
                        was as red as blood, and as white as snow. When the wife looked at her daughter, she loved 
                        her; but when she looked at the little boy, she hated him, and it seemed as if he were always 
                        in her way, and she was always thinking how she could get all the property for her daughter. 
                        The Evil One possessed her so, that she was quite angry with the little boy, and pushed him 
                        about from one corner to another, and cuffed him here and pinched him there, until the 
                        poor child was always in fear. When he came home from school, he could not find a quiet 
                        place to creep into.
                        Once, when the woman went up to her room, her little daughter came up too, and said 
                        “Mother, give me an apple.”
                        “Yes, my child,” said the woman, and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; and the 
                        chest had a great heavy lid, with a great sharp iron lock.
                        “Mother,” said the little daughter, “shall not brother have one too?” 
                       That vexed the woman, but she said, “Yes, when he comes from school.”
                       And when she saw from the window that he was coming, it was just as if the Evil One came 
                       into her, and she snatched away the apple from her daughter, and said, “You shall not have 
                       one before your brother.”
                       Then she threw the apple into the chest, and shut the lid close down. When the little boy 
                       came in at the door, the Evil One made her say kindly, “My son, will you have an apple?”
                       Yet she looked so angry all the time, that the little boy said, “Mother, how dreadful you look! 
                       Yes, give me an apple.”
                       Then she felt that she must speak to him. “Come with me,” said she, and opened the lid; 
                       “pick out an apple for yourself.”
                       And as the little boy stooped over, the Evil One prompted her, and smash! she banged the 
                       lid down, so that his head flew off and fell among the red apples. Then she was seized with 
                       terror, and thought, “Can I get rid of the blame of this?” So she went up to her room to her 
                       chest of drawers, and took out of the top drawer a white cloth, and placed the head on the 
                       neck again, and tied the handkerchief round it, so that one could see nothing, and set him 
                       before the door on a chair, and gave him the apple in his hand.
                       Soon after, little Margery came to her mother, who stood by the kitchen fire, and had a pot 
                       of hot water before her, which she kept stirring round.
                       “Mother,” said little Margery, “brother sits before the door, and looks quite white, and has 
                       an apple in his hand; I asked him to give me the apple, but he did not answer me, and I was 
                       frightened.”
                       “Go to him again,” said her mother, “and if he will not answer you, give him a box on the 
                       ear.”
                       Then Margery went, and said, “Brother, give me the apple.”
                       But he was silent, so she gave him a box on the ear, and the head fell down.
                       She was frightened, and began to cry and sob, and ran to her mother, and said, “Oh, mother, 
                       I have knocked my brother’s head off!” and cried and cried, and would not be comforted.
                       “Margery,” said her mother, “what have you done!—but now be quiet, and no one will 
                       notice; it cannot be helped now—we will cook him in vinegar.”
                       Then the mother took the little boy, and chopped him in pieces, put him into the pot, and 
                       cooked him in vinegar. But Margery stood by, and cried and cried, and all her tears fell into 
                       the pot, so that the cookery did not want any salt.
                       When the father came home, and sat down to dinner, he said, “Where is my son?”
                       The mother brought a great big dish of black soup, and Margery cried and cried without 
                       ceasing. Then the father said again, “Where is my son?”                       
                       “Oh,” said the mother, “he is gone into the country, to see his uncle, where he is going to 
                       stay awhile.”
                       “What does he want there? And he has not even said good-bye to me!”
                       “Oh, he wished very much to go, and asked if he might remain away six weeks; he is well 
                       taken care of there, you know.”
                       “Well,” said the father, “I am sorry; for he ought to have bade me good-bye.”
                       After that he began to eat, and said, “Margery, what are you crying for? Brother will be sure 
                       to come back. Oh, wife,” continued he, “how delicious this food tastes; give me some 
                       more.” And the more he ate, the more he wanted; and he said, “Give me more, you shall not 
                       have any of it; I feel as if it were all mine.” And he ate and ate, throwing the bones under the 
                       table, till he had finished it all.
                       But Margery went to her drawers, and took out of the bottom drawer her best silk 
                       handkerchief, and fetched out all the bones from under the table; she tied them up in the silk 
                       handkerchief, and took them out of doors, and shed bitter tears over them. Then she laid 
                       them under the Juniper-tree in the green grass; and when she had put them there, she felt all 
                       at once quite happy, and did not cry any more.
                       Soon the Juniper began to move, and the twigs kept dividing and then closing, just as if the 
                       tree were clapping its hands for joy. After that there went up from it a sort of mist, and right 
                       in the centre of the mist burnt a fire, and out of the fire flew a beautiful bird, who, singing 
                       deliciously, rose up high in the air. When he was out of sight, the Juniper-tree was just as it 
                       had been before, only the handkerchief with the bones was gone. But Margery felt quite

                       house to dinner.
                       The bird flew away, sat himself on a goldsmith’s house, and began to sing—
                       “My mother, she killed me;
                       My father, he ate me;
                       My sister, little Margery,
                       Gathered up all my bones,
                       Tied them in a silk handkerchief,
                       And laid them under the Juniper-tree:
                       www.tonightsbedtimestory.com
                      Kywitt! Kywitt! what a beautiful bird am I!”
                      The goldsmith sat in his workshop, making a gold chain, but he heard the bird, which sat on 
                      his roof, and sang, and he thought it very beautiful. He stood up, and as he went over the 
                      door-step he lost one slipper. But he went right into the middle of the street, with one 
                      slipper and one sock on; he had on his leather apron; in one hand he carried the gold chain, 
                      and in the other the pincers, while the sun shone brightly up the street. There he stood, and 
                      looked at the bird.
                      “Bird,” said he, “how beautiful you can sing! Sing me that song again.”
                      “No,” said the bird, “I do not sing twice for nothing. Give me that gold chain, and I will sing 
                      it again.”
                      “There,” said the goldsmith; “you shall have the gold chain—now sing me that song once 
                      more.”
                      Then the bird came and took the gold chain in his right claw, and went and sat before the 
                      goldsmith, and sang—
                      “My mother, she killed me;
                      My father, he ate me;
                      My sister, little Margery,
                      Gathered up all my bones,
                      Tied them in a silk handkerchief,
                      And laid them under the Juniper-tree:
                      Kywitt! Kywitt! what a beautiful bird am I!”
                      Afterwards he flew away to a shoemaker’s, and set himself on his roof, and sang—
                      “My mother, she killed me;
                      My father, he ate me;
                      My sister, little Margery,
                      Gathered up all my bones,
                      Tied them in a silk handkerchief,
                      And laid them under the Juniper-tree.
